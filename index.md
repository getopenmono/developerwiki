# Mono Developer Documentation

**_Skip all the talking and just start off with: [Getting started installing the framework](getting-started/install.md), and you are already half way._**

### What to find here?

Here on our developer site, we collect all learning resources about mono. You will find initial getting started guides, followed by tutorials on specific topics, in-depth articles and last (but not least) the API reference docs.

We prioritize to get as much text published fast, instead of keeping our cards close. We hope you like our desicion. Anyway - should you encounter anything you would like to correct - see: [Contributing](#contribute)

### What is Mono anyway?

Haven't you heard the word? Mono is an embedded hardware platform that brings all the goods from [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) and [mbed](http://developer.mbed.org) to a whole new level! No fiddling with voltage levels, open-drain vs pull-up configurations. We take care of all this low-level stuff for you. You just focus on building your application, taking advantage of all the build-in hardware functionalities - like:

* Arm Cortex-M3 MCU
* Touch display
* Battery
* Wifi
* Bluetooth
* Accelerometer
* Temperature Sensor
* SD Card
* General Purpose 3.5mm jack connector

On this developer documentation site, you learn how to use all these features through our high-level API.
